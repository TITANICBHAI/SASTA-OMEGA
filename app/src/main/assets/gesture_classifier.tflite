# TensorFlow Lite Model Placeholder

This file represents where the gesture classification model should be placed.

To add a real model:
1. Train a TensorFlow model for gesture recognition using MediaPipe hand landmarks
2. Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format (.tflite)
3. Replace this file with your trained model
4. Ensure the model expects input shape [1, 63] (21 landmarks Ã— 3 coordinates)
5. Ensure the model outputs probabilities for gesture classes

Without a real model, the MLModelManager will use fallback gesture recognition.
